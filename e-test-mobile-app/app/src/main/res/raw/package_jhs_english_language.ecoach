The two main reasons for building the dam were, to generate electricity and to use the electricity for the production of aluminium from bauxite.</p>\r\n<p>Aluminium is used throughout the world; so both the production of electricity and the production of aluminium are of great value to Ghana</p>\r\n<p>It may seem strange to talk about producing electricity by building a dam, but in fact a lot of dams have been built all over the world for this purpose. What happens is that a concrete wall, called a dam, is constructed across a river at a narrow point. A large lake then develops behind the wall. Tunnels are made in the dam so that water from the lake can rush fiercely through them. This powerful flow of water is used to drive huge machines called turbines, to generate electricity. All that the engineers need is the water rushing down from the lake, and all this costs them nothing! But of course the building of the dam and the fixing of the machines cost a great deal of money.</p>\r\n<p>Big dams have been built in many parts of the world. The Akosombo Dam is one of the biggest. However, the lake, which has been formed is, in fact the biggest man-made lake in the world.</p>",

But when friendship and duty come into conflict, as I once experienced, many problems may occur.</p>\n<p>Almost all my friends and I were leading members of our school's Supporters Club. In the beginning of our final year it was time to elect new officers for the club. Everyone stood the chance of being elected.</p>\n<p>When i was elected as President, I knew it would be a tough job because I would be in charge of my closest friends. The real test would come when the sports season started.</p>\n<p>Just as I had imagined, there were many disputes. No one listened to what I said. Everyone just wanted to have fun instead of cheering our athletes. I knew I had to motivate them and use discipline and that was exactly what i did.</p>\n<p>Many of my friends could not understand this. While some of them stopped coming to the games, others were not talking to me at all.</p>\n<p>I finally decided to have a talk with everyone. I frankly admitted that I did not like the job but since I had it, I was determined to do my best. I also told them to leave the sports matters on the field because my friends were more important to me than the job. From that little talk, I had everything resolved.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Papa opened the door to let in a fast-talking handsome stranger.</p>\r\n<p>According to him he was passing to the next village but there were no vehicles. Therefore he was stranded. My parents with&nbsp;their customary generosity&nbsp;allowed him to stay the rest of day with us.</p>\r\n<p>Soon after, supper was ready. We the younger children had to eat in the kitchen, whilst my parents and the others ate in dining room.</p>\r\n<p>From where we were eating we could hear and see the adults. \"Now, Mr. Anang,\" said the father, \"you being the last to arrive, will share the chicken,\" \"Very well said,\" agreed Mr. Anang. He began by cutting the head of chicken, which he gave to Papa saying, 'You are the head of the &nbsp;family, so you get head.\" \"To my mother,\" he said, \"You are next to the head; therefore, get the neck.\" My elder brother, &nbsp;Yoofi, andsister, Aba, had wings because they were of age and would need wings to fly away from the family nest. The other two guests got the feet in order that they could walk to their destinations. Finally, he declared in a loud voice, &nbsp;a poor wandering man, who must treat my kwashiorkor once and forever, will take the rest!\" There was a long silence after this round dining table.</p>",

The locusts had not come for many years, and only the old people had seen them before.</p>\r\n<p>At first, a fairly small swarm came. And then appeared a slow-moving mass like a sheet of blank cloud drifting towards the villages. Soon it covered half the sky. It was an amazing sight full of power and beauty.</p>\r\n<p>Everyone was now about praying that the locusts should stay in the village for the night. For although most people had never seen locusts before they knew by instinct that they were good to eat. At last they descended. They settled on roofs and covered the bare ground.

They in turn went and told others and at 5 am, when the ceremony was about to begin, there were about seventy people already in the house.</p>\r\n<p>\"Will you bring chairs from the rooms?\" Aboagye requested the young ones among the guests. They entered every room in the house and brought out chairs and benches&nbsp;of all shapes and sizes. They were placed in a circle with the three elders sitting in the centre. \"Where is the child? The ceremony should be completed before the sun rises,\" One of them said.</p>\r\n<p>The mother soon brought the two-week old baby. Twelve calabashes scrubbed the previous day were brought. They looked white and dry. The old man took one and poured some of the gin into it. He raised the head of the child and dipped his finger into the gin. He turned and asked the second elder sitting next to him, \"Have you got the name?\" \"Agyepong alias Koo Kra\".</p>",

She would miss not only her parents but also her friends and wonderful things in America. But her father insisted that she must leave for Ghana because it was necessary for her to learn the culture and language of her motherland, in addition to those of her fatherland is she should have a balanced education. So, Suzzie left for school in Ghana.</p>\r\n<p>Suzzie had been enrolled in international school for only a year, but she already had a lot of influence on her schoolmates. Her arrival on the first day had caused much excitement. Although her mother was black, her skin was as white as her father's. In fact she was the only white girl in the school and this attracted many of the girls to her, while some of the boys avoided her. In the early days, her mates found it difficult to understand her American brand of English while she also wondered how they could so easily dance to the beat of the local drums. But as time passed they learned from one another and Suzzie's white skin ceased to be&nbsp;odd. They ate together, played together, and enjoyed school together.</p>\r\n<p>Soon Suzzie began to dread the thought that she might be asked to go back to her parents. She had become a complete Ghanaian and hoped they would not ask her to return to America.</p>",

Today, Ayele is not talking, though Esinam expects her to say something about her new bag. \"So is that how you are? You are not passing any comment about my schoolbag? Dad gave it to me when he returned from America yesterday.\" Ayele's reply is a mere grunt, but Esinam is in no mood to be unhappy. Ignoring her friend's mood, she breaks into a song about her parents' many acts of love. 'Mum and Dad buy me dresses, shoes and anything I wish for, if I ask.&nbsp;It's great to be young!'</p>\r\n<p>Ayele is strapping on her back an old school bag once used by her elder sister. The brown colour has faded because she washes it too many times. When she breaks her silence she speaks solemnly and without regret. \"I've grown used to the old dresses, bags and shoes Mum buys. She says she can't do more. I trust her and love her.\" There is a&nbsp;tremble&nbsp;in her voice, as though she is about to cry. But her eyes gradually brighten up as she speaks on: 'I'm in J.S.S 3, like you, and we are both doing well. It's great to look to the future with hope.' Esinam nods her head in agreement as the school bell rings and breaks their walk into a gallop</p>",

      "resource": "<p>Once, in the world of animals, there was a great&nbsp;famine&nbsp;and the animals were dying. For about three months, Tortoise and his family had eaten very little. Tortoise's body rattled in his empty shell as he walked. One day as he thought of a way to get food, his throat began to itch.</p>\r\n<p>He would go to the next village where he had heard there was still some food. He would steal some for himself and his family. He took the bush path and arrived at the village after sunset. The people were preparing their meals and the smell made his mouth water.</p>\r\n<p>How would he get this food? Not far away from him was the village playground where there was a big hollow log leaning against a tree. This log was the drum used to summon the villagers for very important announcements. When he reached the tree he decided to climb it so that he could see the village better. Unfortunately, as he was climbing, he fell because he was very weak and hungry. His shell hit the drum, sending out a loud 'kpom! kpom!' noise.</p>\r\n<p>When they heard this noise, the villagers ran to the playground, believing they had been called, thereby leaving the food cooking in their homes.</p>\r\n<p>Very quickly Tortoise disappeared into the nearby bush and ran to the village. He filled his empty shell with as much of food as he could carry and returned home.</p>",

Today, Ayele is not talking, though Esinam expects her to say something about her new bag. \"So is that how you are? You are not passing any comment about my schoolbag? Dad gave it to me when he returned from America yesterday.\" Ayele's reply is a mere grunt, but Esinam is in no mood to be unhappy. Ignoring her friend's mood, she breaks into a song about her parents' many acts of love. 'Mum and Dad buy me dresses, shoes and anything I wish for, if I ask.&nbsp;It's great to be young!'</p>\r\n<p>Ayele is strapping on her back an old school bag once used by her elder sister. The brown colour has faded because she washes it too many times. When she breaks her silence she speaks solemnly and without regret. \"I've grown used to the old dresses, bags and shoes Mum buys. She says she can't do more. I trust her and love her.\" There is a&nbsp;tremble&nbsp;in her voice, as though she is about to cry.

But when he dragged it ashore, he found only a heavy copper pot sealed with lead. He took it and feeling sure it contained something valuable, he took his knife, cut the lead top and turned it upside down. For a moment nothing came out; and then it started to smoke, and this smoke slowly rose right up to the sky like a thick fog. It suddenly turned into a huge genie.</p>\n<p>'Bow down' said the genie 'and let me kill you'.</p>\n<p>'Why?' asked the fisherman. 'Have you forgotten that I set you free?'</p>\n<p>'Yes, but I have sworn to kill you', said the genie. 'I'm a spirit that rebelled against the Creator and to punish me he shut me up in this copper pot. During the first century of my&nbsp;captivity, I swore to make anyone who freed me rich. During my second century, I swore I would grant him any three things. But after these centuries, in anger I swore to kill my liberator without mercy'.</p>\n<p>'Well, die I must', said the fisherman, 'but swear that you really were in that pot.
